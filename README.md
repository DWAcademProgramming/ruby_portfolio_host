# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

## The deployment and why this is still in my portfolio
* I've been attempting to deploy this for a few days, and the issue lies somewhere in how heroku manages the SQLite db.
* I'm not the best with deployment, but having this and a few other projects working locally for both myself and other is priority. 
* The code should work if you download/run it. 
* If you're seeing this, I'd still enjoy going over the app with you and discussing the challenges involved with it.
